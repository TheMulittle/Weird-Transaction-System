# WeirdPaymentSystem

These repositories are intented to be a place where I can practice my development skills as well as my investigation skills when I need to make a decision between two approaches and I don't know how to select them. Futhermore, I'll try always to apply the TDD approach. Here I intend to add the back-end and in the future a front-end. In latter time I might add CI/CD capbility in order to enchance my DevOps skills

The name Weird Payment System comes from the fact that some "business decisions" are far from what a customer would like to have in a payment system, but simplifies a lot the need to develop consumer services. One such example is the fact that a Reciever Institution needs to perform a REST call in order to check payments they are receiving instead of being informed by the WPS directly that avoids the need for a second service for simulating the Institutions or a mock for the service
